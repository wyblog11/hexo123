注意 瞬间动词通常是不能用现在完成时表持续性的，但其否定结构则可以。如：

1) since 自从
I have been there many times since the war.

We haven’t seen each other since last week.

6)  This is + 形容词最高级 + that … 这是最…
This is the best film that I’ve (ever) seen.


6. 现在完成时与一般过去时的区别
1) 现在完成时强调对现在的影响和结果，与现在有联系；
而一般过去时强调这个动作发生的时间是在过去，不涉及对现在的影响。如：
I have seen this film. （我已经看过了这部电影）

I saw this film yesterday. （我是昨天看的这部电影）


2) 现在完成时常与模糊的时间状语连用（如for, since, so far, ever, never, just, yet, till/until, up to now, always等），或者干脆没有时间状语；
而一般过去时常与具体的时间状语连用（如yesterday, last night, …ago, in 1980, in February等）。

3) 现在完成时表示持续时一般使用延续性动词（如live, teach, work, know等）；
而一般过去时常使用瞬间动词（如begin, buy, die, marry等）。如：
He has lived in Hangzhou since last spring.

My grandfather bought the car five years ago.


7. 易错点辨析

1)  考生容易把一些瞬间动词用现在完成时表达，这是错误的。如：
(×) He has died for two years. 他死了两年了。

(√) He has been dead for two years.

(√) He died two years ago.

(×) The film has begun for 10 minutes. 电影开演十分钟了。

(√) The film has been on for 10 minutes.

(√) The film began 10 minutes ago.

(×) She has married for three years. 她结婚有三年了。

(√) She has been married for three years.

(√) She married Mike three years ago.


2) 考生不懂如何区分have been to和have gone to，尽管两者均可后接地点，但have been to表示去过某地（现在已经回来了），have gone to表示到某地去了（现在还没回来）。如：
She has been to Paris (three times).

She has gone to Paris.


7

过去完成时

标志：had + 动词的过去分词

1. 表示在过去的某个时间或动作以前已经发生的动作或已经存在的状态。如：
By the end of last week he had finished the work.

He had left when I arrived.


2.  表示从过去某一时间开始，一直延续到过去另一时间的动作或状态。如：
We had not seen each other since I left Beijing.

The film had been on for 5 minutes when I got to the cinema.


3. 某些表意向的动词（如intend, think, plan, expect, hope等）的过去完成时表示主语未曾实现的愿望、希望、打算。如：
I had intended to visit you last night, but someone called and I couldn’t get away.

We had hoped that you would come, but you didn’t.


4. （虚拟语气）在条件状体从句或wish / would rather等后面的从句中，使用过去完成时表示与过去事实相反的主观愿望。如：
The party wouldn’t have been so perfect if you hadn’t come.

I wish I had gone with you to the concert that day.


5.  过去完成时与一般过去时
1) 基本区别：过去完成时表示以过去某时间为起点以前所发生的动作或存在的状态，即过去完成时强调“过去的过去”，而一般过去时只表示以现在时间为起点以前所发生的事情或存在的状态。如：
He studied there two years ago.他两年前在那儿学习（离现在两年）

He said he had studied there two years before.他说他两年前在那儿学习过。（离他说话时两年）


2) 特别注意：两个动作如果按顺序发生，又不强调先后，或者用then, and, but等连词连接时，多用一般过去时。如：
When she saw the mouse, she screamed.

My aunt gave me a hat and I lost it.

过去将来时

标志：would + 动词原形

1. 表示从过去某一时间来看将要发生的动作或存在的状态，一般用于主句为过去时的宾语从句中。如：
He said he would come here next Friday.

I knew that he would help us when we were in trouble.


2. 表示过去的动作习惯或倾向：
The old man would sit on a bench in the quite park for hours without doing anything.

When I worked on that farm, I would get up at 5 am.


3. 用于虚拟语气中：
If I were you, I would not do that.

If he were here, he would show us how to do it.


4. 过去将来时的其他形式
1)  was / were going to + 动词原形。如：
He told us that he was going to attend the meeting.

She said that I was going to be sent to meet her at the railway station.


2) was / were to + 动词原形。如：
The building was to be completed next month.

Li Lei was to arrive soon.


3)  was / were about to + 动词原形。如：
We were about to leave there when it began to rain heavily and suddenly.

He was about to have lunch when the bell rang.
